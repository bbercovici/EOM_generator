# EOM_generator
Python program returning the symbolic equations of motion of a system of rigid bodies.
As of last commit, the software can solve any problem formulated in terms of a minimum
set of generalized coordinates as long as the kinetic energy and the potential 
energy of this system are formulated in terms of the generalized coordinates and problem constants.
An example of how it works is provided in **symbolic_EOM_example.py**, 
where the EOMs of an inverted pendulum are computed and displayed. 
To run this example, all you have to do is:

```
run symbolic_EOM_example.py
```
