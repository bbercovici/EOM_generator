# EOM_generator
Multi-purpose Python program deriving and integrating the equations of motion of a dynamical system.
As of last commit, the software can solve any problem formulated in terms of a minimum
set of generalized coordinates as long as the kinetic energy and the potential 
energy of this system are formulated in terms of the generalized coordinates and problem constants.
An example of how it works is provided in **cannonball.py**, 
where the EOMs of a flying cannonbal are computed and integrated:


```
run cannonball.py
```
